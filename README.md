## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://jessicaragnar.github.io/Sunnyside-agency-landing-page/)

## My process

I began by outlining the project and followed Kevin Powell's video series, 'Build a Responsive Website with HTML & CSS,' parts one and two, coding along with each tutorial. 
Starting with the root folder and the HTML structure, I then tackled one section at a time. I ensured responsiveness as I progressed, leaving some of the more challenging parts for the end. 
I particularly struggled with the small section at the top of the mobile menu before realizing it had a relatively simple solution, thanks to CodewithSadee.

My solution includes a bit more JavaScript than necessary because it was a requirement for the assignment in my educational program.

I'm already looking forward to revisiting this project in a year or so to see how much more I've learned by then!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was a project I attempted for a course in my educational program. I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS from those days when you could modify the design of "your" page on whatever social platform you were using, changing the background to purple or having annoying music playing. Those were great days!
However, almost twenty years later, much has changed, and I was thrilled to learn many new things, such as flexbox—I love those—root, and utility classes.

It was great fun to take a design and try to come as close to it as possible, attempting to stay true to what would be the client's expectations if this were a real-life experience.
I started this project on November 20th, and I would estimate that I spent around four workdays on it, split over the week.

I've been so muched helped and inspired by others doing this project and sharing their solutions. It's fascinating to witness the variety of solutions people come up with.

### Continued development

I still have much to learn, and I feel a bit out of touch with what's considered best practice. Responsive design wasn't even a thing when I started learning about programming back in the day, so there's much more to explore in the field!
